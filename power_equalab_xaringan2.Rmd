## Psychological studies are under-powered

![Power in psychology studies](Stanley et al - Table1.jpg)
#### General Aim: run studies with at least **80% power**
#### Studies reporting **mean differences** - likely experiments - particularly underpowered

# Simulation results - 20% power

#### Results of **5000 experiments** with *d* = .2, *N* = 63 per group

``` {r echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
simulate_t <- function(n, d) {
  group1 <- rnorm(n)
  group2 <- rnorm(n, d)

  d <- (mean(group2) - mean(group1)) / ((sd(group1) + sd(group2)) / 2)

  tt <-t.test(group2, group1, var.equal = TRUE)
  t <- tt$statistic
  p <- tt$p.value

  tibble(n = n, d = d, t = t, p = p)

d <- .2

```

#### Minimum significant effect size: *d* = `r fmt_cor(effectsize::t_to_d(abs(qt(0.025, 2*n-2)), 2*n-2)[[1]])`
#### Average significant effect size: *d* = `r fmt_cor(mean(simulations$d[simulations$p<=.05]))`
#### Share of studies with significant results: `r fmt_pct(mean(simulations$p<=.05))`

# *Why* is this bad?

--

- **80% of studies yield false negatives** - so *p-hacking* starts <br><br>

--

- True positives **overestimate** effect by `r fmt_pct(mean(simulations$d[simulations$p<=.05])/d - 1)` (which ensures that future studies are under-powered)<br><br>

--

- If we had **no p-hacking** and test **50% true hypotheses**, this means that *1 out 5* significant research findings would be false. (We *know* there is p-hacking.)

# Better!

--

- **80%** of studies yield true positives - but, there are **20%** false negatives <br><br>

--

- (This means that a 67% of 5-study papers should have a non-significant result.)<sup>1</sup><br><br>

--

- True positives **still overestimate** effect by `r fmt_pct(mean(simulations$d[simulations$p<=.05])/d - 1)` (consider in power calculations)<br><br>

# How to run high-powered studies?

---

## Factors that influence statistical power

- &alpha; level
--

  - multiple comparisons (*planned contrasts*)<br>
--

- effect size
  - true effect
  - measurement error<br>
--

- statistical procedure
  - e.g., binning data
  - repeated measures<br>
--

- sample size
---

## Example 

We run a 2x2 study - gender x intervention - and primarily care about the intervention effects by gender.
--
<br><br>**Base case:** 50 participants per cell, d = .4, &alpha; = .05/6 (*Bonferroni* for all post-hoc tests) <br>
power: `pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/6)`: `r fmt_pct(pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/6)$power)`
--
<br><br>**Focus on two post-hoc tests:**   <br>
power: `pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/2)`: `r fmt_pct(pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/2)$power)`
--
<br><br>and **Increase effect size** (e.g., improve measurement): <br>
`pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .6, sig.level = .05/2)`: `r fmt_pct(pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .6, sig.level = .05/2)$power)`
--
<br><br>or **Switch towards repeated measures** / paired tests:  <br>
  `pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/2, type = "paired")`: `r fmt_pct(pwr.t.test(n = 50, d = .4, sig.level = .05/2, type = "paired")$power)`
--
<br><br>or **increase sample size** to 150 participants per cell:  <br>
  power: `pwr.t.test(n = 150, d = .4, sig.level = .05/6)`: `r fmt_pct(pwr.t.test(n = 150, d = .4, sig.level = .05/6)$power)`

## Effect sizes

---

## Power depends on effect size

.pull-left[

- Need to decide on expected effect size, ideally for specific field

--

- *Not* based on under-powered previous studies
- *Definitely not* based on under-powered pilot study!

--

- Look for **meta-analyses** that consider publication bias.

--

- Effect sizes can easily be converted (e.g., *r* to *d* or *f*), e.g., with this [online converter](https://www.escal.site/)

--

- Always express the association/difference as a share of the variance (true variance + measurement error).
]

.pull-right[

--

- If necessary, consider heuristics, but not (just) Cohen!

> Benchmarks are "recommended for use only when no better basis for estimating the index is available" (Cohen, 1988)

--

![Observed effect sizes in social psychology](power benchmarks.jpg)
--

- Other fields (e.g., [education](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmpo/documents/WP15337_Web_Version.pdf)) have smaller average effect sizes, and many reviews might suffer from publication bias

## How to calculate power

- G*Power ([guide](https://osf.io/zqphw/)) works for most (simple) situations

- So does the `pwr` package in R [[introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIjOG8LTTh8)], and the results are more transparent (all setting in the command) 

- For (relatively simple) mediation models, there is a good [simulation webapp](https://schoemanna.shinyapps.io/mc_power_med/) that can also be [run in RStudio](https://marlab.org/power_mediation/) (faster)<sup>1</sup>

- For 2x2 ANOVAs, there are also some good webapps - in a moment.

- Detailed examples and suggestions for further tools (as well as more on effect sizes) can be found in this [collaborative guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_vNjPCI7H52T8tav1reYgWx6puMT03JZVY1wvEPHrWU/edit#)

.footnote[
[1] Just in case: I have written an extension to this for three parallel mediators. If you need that, you can run `shiny::runGitHub("mc_power_med", "LukasWallrich")`

## The problem with interactions

.pull-left[

#### Sample size requirements

- Let's consider testing a large main effect (giving people a placebo pill, assuming *d* = .6) - 44 participants per group, 88 in total for 80 % power.

--

- Now, let's hypothesize that some moderator *eliminates* the effect in a 2x2 design (e.g., telling some that it is a placebo). Now we have four groups, and a smaller effect - so need *twice* the number of participants *per cell* - instead of 2 * 44, now 2 * 2 * (2 * 44), i.e. 4x the original sample.

--

- Usually, moderator won't *eliminate* the effect, but *attenuate* it. If 30% of effect remains, we need 4 times as many per cell - 8x the original sample.

--

- See [Datacolada](http://datacolada.org/17) for further details and the implications for three-way interactions (*spoiler:* need 32 times the sample size.)

## Difficulties with effect size estimation

--

- Effect size very hard to estimate. Best approach can be to draw the expected simple slopes and identify the expected pattern of means.

--

- There is an intuitive [web app](https://markhw.shinyapps.io/power_twoway/) to support this - but did not work as of today. If you have RStudio, you can also [download it from Github](https://github.com/markhwhiteii/power_twoway) and run it locally.

--

- A slightly less intuitive but more powerful webapp can be found [here](https://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/anova_power/) - also allows for between-factors and produces reports that you can save.

--

- (Often, continuous variables are binned for this - increases measurement error, and thus typically decreases effect size.)
